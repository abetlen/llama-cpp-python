Simple Python bindings for **@ggerganov's** [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) library.
This package provides:

- Low-level access to C API via `ctypes` interface.
- High-level Python API for text completion
  - OpenAI-like API
  - LangChain compatibility

## Installation

Install from PyPI (requires a c compiler):

```bash
pip install llama-cpp-python
```

The above command will attempt to install the package and build build `llama.cpp` from source.
This is the recommended installation method as it ensures that `llama.cpp` is built with the available optimizations for your system.

This method defaults to using `make` to build `llama.cpp` on Linux / MacOS and `cmake` on Windows.
You can force the use of `cmake` on Linux / MacOS setting the `FORCE_CMAKE=1` environment variable before installing.

## High-level API

```python
>>> from llama_cpp import Llama
>>> llm = Llama(model_path="./models/7B/ggml-model.bin")
>>> output = llm("Q: Name the planets in the solar system? A: ", max_tokens=32, stop=["Q:", "\n"], echo=True)
>>> print(output)
{
  "id": "cmpl-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "object": "text_completion",
  "created": 1679561337,
  "model": "./models/7B/ggml-model.bin",
  "choices": [
    {
      "text": "Q: Name the planets in the solar system? A: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.",
      "index": 0,
      "logprobs": None,
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 14,
    "completion_tokens": 28,
    "total_tokens": 42
  }
}
```

## Web Server

`llama-cpp-python` offers a web server which aims to act as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API.
This allows you to use llama.cpp compatible models with any OpenAI compatible client (language libraries, services, etc).

To install the server package and get started:

```bash
pip install llama-cpp-python[server]
export MODEL=./models/7B/ggml-model.bin
python3 -m llama_cpp.server
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to see the OpenAPI documentation.

## Docker image

A Docker image is available on [GHCR](https://ghcr.io/abetlen/llama-cpp-python). To run the server:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p8000:8000 -v /path/to/models:/models -eMODEL=/models/ggml-model-name.bin ghcr.io/abetlen/llama-cpp-python:latest
```

## Low-level API

The low-level API is a direct `ctypes` binding to the C API provided by `llama.cpp`.
The entire API can be found in [llama_cpp/llama_cpp.py](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/blob/master/llama_cpp/llama_cpp.py) and should mirror [llama.h](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/llama.h).

# Development

This package is under active development and I welcome any contributions.

To get started, clone the repository and install the package in development mode:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:abetlen/llama-cpp-python.git
# Will need to be re-run any time vendor/llama.cpp is updated
python3 setup.py develop
```

# How does this compare to other Python bindings of `llama.cpp`?

I originally wrote this package for my own use with two goals in mind:

- Provide a simple process to install `llama.cpp` and access the full C API in `llama.h` from Python
- Provide a high-level Python API that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API so existing apps can be easily ported to use `llama.cpp`

Any contributions and changes to this package will be made with these goals in mind.
